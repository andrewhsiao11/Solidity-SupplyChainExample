# Solidity-SupplyChainExample

A simple supply chain example implemented on the blockchain. Smart contracts written in Solidity, that allow for automated dispatchment of items upon payment as well as payment collection without a middlemen. 

An owner can create an item and set its cost in Ether. This item then has its own address, where a buyer can sent the appropraite amount of funds to. This will set the status of the item to paid and trigger a
a notification that it is ready to be delivered. The owner can then trigger the item for dispatch and set its state to deliver.
